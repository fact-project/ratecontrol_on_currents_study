Some time ago I did a study on how the measured G-APD current and the
currently set (patch-) trigger threshold affects the (patch-)rate.
In order to speed up the "ratecontrol", i.e. the threshold controlling process, which intends to keep the trigger rate constantly aroung 60..70 Hz even under changing ambient light conditions.

Well ,... I did that study, and now came back to it and found it
to be a mess.

So I start checking stuff in and getting rid of stuff, I don't like anymore.

I cannot work with the aux-DB set up by Max yet, since it doesn't contain the values I need to look at.

Ah yes, most of the aux-files I look at have some "problems", i.e.
they contain data, which needs to be at least a little bit "treated" in order to be usable for further study.

This pre-conditioning is more than half of the study, finding the dependency of the rate $\nu$ from the current $I$ and the threshold $N$ is very easy, once the raw-data can be correlated.
